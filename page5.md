<h2>Personal pronouns</h2>
A common way we refer to people is by using personal pronouns. In French, the pronouns (you and they) are complicated by gender and formality. You’ll use slightly different variations of these words depending on who you are referring to and how well you know them.

<h2>Basic conjugation: Present tense</h2>
Let’s take the verb “manger” (to eat) for example. Note the way it is written at the end.

    <td>You eat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Elle/Il mange</td>
    <td>She/He eats</td>

    <td>We eat</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

When an English-speaking learner of French looks at this, it’s quite overwhelming… In English, you add an "S" to the third person singular (he, she, it). But except for a few irregular verbs like to be, the verb is not going to change much. <br>
The example of the verb “manger” was what we call “a regular verb” in French, verbs which follow the exact same conjugation pattern.
<h4>What is the logic behind the conjugation of regular verbs?</h4>
<ol>
<il>Remove the “er” – this will give you what is called “the stem” in grammatical jargon.<br>
 Parler – er = parl</il>
<li>To the stem, add the ending corresponding the the subject pronoun<br>
Je = stem + e = je parle
Tu = stem + es = tu parles
Il, elle, on = stem + e = il, elle, on parle
Nous = stem + ons = nous parlons
Vous = stem + ez = vous parlez
Ils, elles + stem + ent = ils, elles parlent</il>
</ol>
