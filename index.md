<h1>Homework 1</h1>

<h2>Section 1: Description of myself</h2>
<p> Hello! My name is Camille. I was born in Belgium in 1997 and I have lived in Ottignies, a small city not so far from Brussels, since my birth. In the context of my master in multilingual communication at  the Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium, I am currently doing an Erasmus at Queen Mary University of London in the school of Languages, Linguistics and Film. I have lived in London for less than a month but I really look forward to learning more about this city and about the United Kingdom in general.
