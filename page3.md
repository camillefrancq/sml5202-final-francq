<h2>Exercise8</h2>
Learning the vocabulary of days of the weeks, months and some other temporal indicators will help you to situate your actions in time when holding a conversation with native speakers of French. 
The simplest method for learning to speak the days of the week is by heart. Read the words out aloud a few times and you'll quickly learn them by heart.
As you can read and listen to the sounds of the words for the months in French, you will notice that they are very similar to English and should not give you any problems in learning by heart. Listen and repeat as often as possible.
