<h3>Dos and Don’ts for French Greetings</h3>
The proper etiquette for greeting people in Belgium rdepends on a few factors. While it’s expected and considered polite to greet everyone, from colleagues to shopkeepers, the way you greet each person depends on your relationship with them and the social setting. For example…
<ul>
 <li><strong>Les bises (kisses)</strong> are a typical greeting when meeting friends in Belgium.</li>
 <li>A <strong>handshake</strong> is a greeting that is reserved for formal or business settings.
When entering a meeting for work, it’s normal for colleagues to offer a firm handshake. It’s also common for men to greet with a handshake rather than with une bise.</li>
 <li> A <strong>hug</strong>, contrary to American greetings, is reserved for close family members or significant others only.
A hug is seen as an invasion of privacy to the French and can make someone feel awkward or uncomfortable if you don’t know them well enough.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time indicators</h2>
<h3>Exercise8</h3>
Last but not least, what about learning to express time? 
Learning the vocabulary of days of the weeks, months and some other temporal indicators will help you to situate your actions in time when holding a conversation with native speakers of French. 
The simplest method for learning to speak the days of the week is by heart. Read the words out aloud a few times and you'll quickly learn them by heart.
As you can read and listen to the sounds of the words for the months in French, you will notice that they are very similar to English and should not give you any problems in learning by heart. Listen and repeat as often as possible.
